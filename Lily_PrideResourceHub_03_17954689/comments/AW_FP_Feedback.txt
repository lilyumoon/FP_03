Questions:

Are you pleased with your progress so far?

	I think so. I like the flatpickr calendar. I wish I had API access to the den.


Is there anything you need from me?

	I'm good for now!

Lily, great news. With the help of another student, Ashley Sluiter, we got your code to fully run in my project. The issue was that I use a workspace. The solution was the use of the base tag. With use of the base tag, some changes needed to be done to your hrefs. Here are two references for base:



https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp



https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base



I attached your project so you can see were base was added. Basically, we added base to all your html files, however the top-level index file is different than the ones in a subfolder. There also needed to be changes to the data files in your JS.



If you have questions, please contact me. This should fully work in your project, but I would extract the contents into your usual environment and try it out. I ran your project using Live Server.



UseBase.zip




*******************************************

Lily, I have trouble running your project even when using the Go Live Server extension.

Here are the changes I made to get it to run using Go Live Server extension:

The image on your top-level index.html page is broken unless I add a dot before you leading slash.

In load_components.js, I removed one of the dots on lines 6 and 7.

In the header/footer, I added one dot to the src for the images.

With those changes (including use Go Live Server) your project went from 13 errors down to 6. Those errors are for the fonts in style.css. If I added dots, the number of font errors increased.

I added one dot to the hrefs in header.html so I could get to those pages, but the header/footer and styles are not applied to the pages.

Using learning.html as my test case, I could get the styles to work by adding two dots to there hrefs. However, load_components.js never worked from here. Depending on what I did to the script tag, this is the error I received (the ... represents the path):

Refused to execute script from ... because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.

I did some research and tried a few things, but finally needed to move on.

What are you using to develop and test your project?

Questions:
------------------------

Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	
	I do feel good about my progress so far. In terms of technical skills and knowledge, I feel like I'm getting much more back "up to speed" with HTML, CSS, and JS, and beginning to gain a lot of momentum.

	I feel like I'm also improving with considering accessibility and layout with various device sizes. 
		- (Thank you for pointing me toward @media! I had completely forgotten about screen size breakpoints. I added one to start with.)

	I have a good amount of work ahead of me in terms of gathering, curating, and creating the content for this. The home page is feeling kind of bare, but will be expanded upon as the other pages fill out. I'm feeling excited about it.



Is there anything you need from me?

	I have a lot of fonts right now and intend to remove those which I don't use as I get a better feel for the styling.  
		- I downloaded the .otf files from https://font.download/font/helvetica-neue-5
			- these are free for personal use
		- I converted them to .woff and .woff2 via https://transfonter.org/

		- Should my @font-face definitions at the top of style.css be separated into their own .css file?

	I created a pseudo banner / logo because I'm not sure if this whole thing is a potential intellectual property issue
		- There is inconsistency in this approach, because I referenced specific campus locations in the footer to add content to build out the footer framework

		- I'd like to standardize my approach and presentation. Do you think I should follow through and further distance this project from Northwood Tech as an entity, and simply parallel it?
			- Or should I feel okay about leaning into it since this will eventually be transformed into content for the site anyways?

Lily, I am more than willing to make accommodations and for me, they do not need to be formally documented. For the final presentation, we can set up a time for you to present synchronously.

A couple of things to keep in mind as you progress through the IT Web program. In my first two Java courses, students do oral presentations, but I do accept detailed written ones. In my last Java course, students do video presentations which entails answering interpersonal interview questions. HOWEVER, I retire at the end of this school year, so I do not know what future assignments will be. My suspicion is that at least the fall semester courses will be the same. 

I like your project idea and look forward to seeing the finished product.


Fixes:
------------------------
Tell me how and where you made the fixes

Changes: 
	- I refactored the header and footer to be contained within their own .html files for versatility, consistency, and ease of maintenance
		- the load_component.js script is wrapped in each page's head element and is currently set up to dynamically replace the innerHTML of the page's .header and .footer div with code from their cooresponding files after the DOM loads
	- I separated the header and footer css out of style.css and gave each a dedicated .css file
	- I created an individual .css file for each page (which I have not used yet, but intend to)
	- I added a screen size breakpoint in style.css, header.css, and footer.css
