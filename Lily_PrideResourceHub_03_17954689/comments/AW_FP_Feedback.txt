Questions:
------------------------

Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	
	I do feel good about my progress so far. In terms of technical skills and knowledge, I feel like I'm getting much more back "up to speed" with HTML, CSS, and JS, and beginning to gain a lot of momentum.

	I feel like I'm also improving with considering accessibility and layout with various device sizes. 
		- (Thank you for pointing me toward @media! I had completely forgotten about screen size breakpoints. I added one to start with.)

	I have a good amount of work ahead of me in terms of gathering, curating, and creating the content for this. The home page is feeling kind of bare, but will be expanded upon as the other pages fill out. I'm feeling excited about it.



Is there anything you need from me?

	I have a lot of fonts right now and intend to remove those which I don't use as I get a better feel for the styling.  
		- I downloaded the .otf files from https://font.download/font/helvetica-neue-5
			- these are free for personal use
		- I converted them to .woff and .woff2 via https://transfonter.org/

		- Should my @font-face definitions at the top of style.css be separated into their own .css file?

	I created a pseudo banner / logo because I'm not sure if this whole thing is a potential intellectual property issue
		- There is inconsistency in this approach, because I referenced specific campus locations in the footer to add content to build out the footer framework

		- I'd like to standardize my approach and presentation. Do you think I should follow through and further distance this project from Northwood Tech as an entity, and simply parallel it?
			- Or should I feel okay about leaning into it since this will eventually be transformed into content for the site anyways?

Lily, I am more than willing to make accommodations and for me, they do not need to be formally documented. For the final presentation, we can set up a time for you to present synchronously.

A couple of things to keep in mind as you progress through the IT Web program. In my first two Java courses, students do oral presentations, but I do accept detailed written ones. In my last Java course, students do video presentations which entails answering interpersonal interview questions. HOWEVER, I retire at the end of this school year, so I do not know what future assignments will be. My suspicion is that at least the fall semester courses will be the same. 

I like your project idea and look forward to seeing the finished product.


Fixes:
------------------------
Tell me how and where you made the fixes

Changes: 
	- I refactored the header and footer to be contained within their own .html files for versatility, consistency, and ease of maintenance
		- the load_component.js script is wrapped in each page's head element and is currently set up to dynamically replace the innerHTML of the page's .header and .footer div with code from their cooresponding files after the DOM loads
	- I separated the header and footer css out of style.css and gave each a dedicated .css file
	- I created an individual .css file for each page (which I have not used yet, but intend to)
	- I added a screen size breakpoint in style.css, header.css, and footer.css
